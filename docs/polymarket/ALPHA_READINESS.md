# Objective Alpha Readiness

Status: Active
Last updated: June 29, 2026
Authority: Single readiness dashboard for Phase 1 - First Automated Dollar

## Objective Alpha

> The first fully autonomous paper trade from signal generation through result
> recording without human intervention.

## Readiness values

The only allowed readiness values are:

- `NOT_STARTED`
- `IN_PROGRESS`
- `BLOCKED`
- `READY`

Readiness is categorical. Percentages are prohibited.

## Current readiness

| Component | Owner | Readiness | Blocker reference | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Signal generation path | Repricing | READY | None | Frozen detector capability exists; this does not authorize strategy changes. |
| Continuous autonomous engine | Shared | IN_PROGRESS | ALPHA-B001 | Third soak completed 24 hours and reconciled paper state, but stopped four terminal source records early. |
| Automated paper execution | Repricing | READY | ALPHA-B002 | The first soak persisted 60 unique public-input positions and 60 closed trades under the frozen fingerprint. |
| Restart-safe recovery | Repricing | IN_PROGRESS | ALPHA-B003 | Component tests pass; integrated recovery evidence remains required. |
| Supervisor process | Infrastructure | IN_PROGRESS | ALPHA-B004 | Sleep inhibition and bounded shutdown passed; terminal-drain behavior still requires correction and validation. |
| Telegram live alerts | Infrastructure | NOT_STARTED | ALPHA-B005 | No approved live alert path is integrated with the paper runtime. |
| Daily automatic reporting | Shared | IN_PROGRESS | ALPHA-B006 | Third-soak reporting stayed current but did not incorporate runtime-verified terminal source health. |
| Production health monitoring | Infrastructure | IN_PROGRESS | ALPHA-B007 | Sustained 24-hour heartbeat passed; final `session_completed` consumption and health reporting remain missing. |
| End-to-end Objective Alpha cycle | Shared | BLOCKED | ALPHA-B008 | Blocked by unresolved component blockers. |

## Update rule

Readiness changes require source evidence and a corresponding update to the
referenced blocker. `READY` means the component's exit condition is met; it
does not imply that Objective Alpha is complete unless the end-to-end component
is also `READY`.
